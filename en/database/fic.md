## What is a FIC file?

The FIC file in WinDev is a compiled version of a HyperFileSQL Database. The acronym FIC stands for "Fichier de Code" in French, which translates to "Code File" in English. In WINDEV, a FIC file is a compiled file that contains the executable code of a project. The file has the extension .fic and it is created when you compile a WINDEV project. Once a project is compiled into a FIC file, it can be distributed to users as an executable program or an installation package. 

FIC file is related to WINDEV, a software development tool created by PCSoft, a French company. It allows developers to create Windows, web, and mobile applications using a single code base. It includes a visual development environment, a programming language (WLangage), and a variety of pre-built controls and functions for common tasks. It is primarily used for business applications and has a strong user base in Europe.

## Relation with HyperFileSQL Mobile database

In WinDev, a FIC file that is created for a HyperFileSQL Mobile database contains the executable code for the database, as well as the data contained within the database. HyperFileSQL Mobile is a relational database management system that is included with WINDEV and is designed specifically for mobile and offline applications. The FIC file can be distributed as a standalone executable file or as part of an installation package, and it can be run on the target device to access and manage the data in the HyperFileSQL Mobile database. When the FIC file is run, it will open the database and make the data available for use in the mobile application.
